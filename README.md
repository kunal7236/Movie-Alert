# booking-watch

Get a **Telegram** ping the moment a specific **movie + theatre** opens booking
on BookMyShow / District. Runs itself every ~10 minutes on **GitHub Actions**,
so there's nothing to keep running on your own machine.

It works by polling a URL you choose and watching for the transition from
"not bookable" to "booking open" for your theatre. Nothing site-specific is
hardcoded, so if BookMyShow/District tweak their pages you just edit
`config.json` — not the code.

---

## 1. Create a Telegram bot (2 minutes)

1. In Telegram, message **@BotFather** → send `/newbot` → follow prompts.
2. It gives you a **bot token** like `123456:ABC-DEF...`. Save it.
3. Open a chat with your new bot and send it any message (e.g. `hi`). This is
   required before it can message you.
4. Get your **chat id**: open this URL in a browser (paste your token):
   ```
   https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN>/getUpdates
   ```
   Look for `"chat":{"id":123456789` — that number is your `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`.

## 2. Find the URL to watch

You want the URL where showtimes for your movie appear. Two options:

**A. Simple (the showtimes page).** On BookMyShow, open the movie's
"Book tickets" page for your city and copy the address bar URL, e.g.
`https://in.bookmyshow.com/movies/<slug>/buytickets/<code>/<city>`.
This is the easiest and works for most cases.

**B. Most reliable (the internal API).** These sites load showtimes via a
background request. To capture it:
1. Open the showtimes page in Chrome, press **F12** → **Network** tab.
2. Filter by **Fetch/XHR**, reload the page.
3. Find the request whose response contains venue/showtime data (search the
   responses for your theatre's name).
4. Right-click it → **Copy** → **Copy as cURL**, and copy the request URL.
5. If it needs headers/cookies, add them as a JSON object in the
   `HEADERS_JSON` secret (see below).

> Note: these internal APIs aren't official and may change or require cookies.
> If option B stops working, fall back to option A. Keep the poll interval
> polite (the default 10 min is fine).

## 3. Configure

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
```

Edit `config.json`:
- `movie`   — the movie title as it appears on the page (helps avoid false hits).
- `theatre` — the theatre name exactly as shown on the site.
- `target_url` — the URL from step 2.

Matching is case-insensitive and whitespace-tolerant. Booking counts as "open"
when the theatre name **and** a booking signal (`book tickets`, `showtime`, ...)
are both present, and it's not showing only `notify me` / `coming soon`.

## 4. Test locally (optional but recommended)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:ABC...
export TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=123456789
python poller.py
```

It prints `available=True/False`. To confirm Telegram works, temporarily point
`target_url` at a page you know lists the theatre with booking open — you
should get a message.

## 5. Deploy on GitHub Actions

1. Create a **new GitHub repo** and push these files to it:
   ```bash
   git init && git add . && git commit -m "init booking-watch"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<you>/booking-watch.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
2. In the repo: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**
   and add:
   - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
   - `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`
   - `HEADERS_JSON` *(optional — only for API URLs that need headers/cookies)*
3. The workflow (`.github/workflows/booking-watch.yml`) runs every 10 minutes
   automatically. Trigger a test run anytime from the **Actions** tab →
   *booking-watch* → **Run workflow**.

When booking opens you get one Telegram message. State is saved in `state.json`
(committed back by the workflow) so you aren't re-notified every run.

### Public vs private repo

- **Public repo:** GitHub Actions minutes are **unlimited & free**. Recommended.
  Nothing sensitive is exposed — your token/chat id live in encrypted Secrets,
  only the movie/theatre/URL are in `config.json`.
- **Private repo:** the free tier gives ~2000 Actions minutes/month. Running
  every 10 min (~4300 runs/mo) would exceed it — bump the cron in the workflow
  to `*/30 * * * *` (every 30 min) to stay comfortably under.

## Adjusting

- **Interval:** edit the `cron` line in `.github/workflows/booking-watch.yml`
  (`*/10 * * * *` = every 10 min; GitHub's minimum is 5 and runs may lag a few
  minutes).
- **Multiple movies/theatres:** duplicate the folder into separate repos, or
  extend `config.json` into a list and loop in `poller.py` (ask and I'll wire
  it up).
- **False positives/negatives:** tune `open_signals` / `closed_signals` in
  `config.json`.
